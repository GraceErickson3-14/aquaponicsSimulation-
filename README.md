# aquaponicsSimulation-


We created a simulation of an Aquaponics System - The step motor runs for one second (a complete rotation) once 
every 24 hours to feed the fish. The photo-resistor monitors the “water level.” Rather than using actual water, 
we represented water using light. When the photo-resistor detected light, the LED turned on to alert that the 
“water level” is low. When in darkness, the LED turned off meaning that the water level is high. This project 
involved a timer, interrupts, inputs, and outputs.
